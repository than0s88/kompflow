# Kompflow

A Kanban app with workspaces, boards, drag-and-drop cards, and a live activity feed. The whole stack — Postgres, NestJS API, React web, Pusher-compatible realtime server — boots from a single `docker compose up`.

> **For reviewers:** clone this repo, run `docker compose up --build`, open `http://localhost:5173`, register an account, and you're in. No `.env` file, no local Node/pnpm/Postgres install required. Only Docker Desktop.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/than0s88/kompflow.git
cd kompflow
docker compose up --build
```

First build takes 3–5 minutes (downloads Node + Postgres + Soketi base images, installs ~800 packages, compiles the API and web bundle). Subsequent boots take seconds.

When build finishes, open:

- **App:** http://localhost:5173
- **API:** http://localhost:3001/api (returns 404 directly — that's normal; auth-protected routes live under it)

### Demo data is auto-loaded

The API container auto-runs the demo seeder on every boot, right after applying the Prisma schema. By the time the web app is reachable, the database already contains:

- Two test accounts (see below)
- One shared workspace (`Alex's Workspace`) with both accounts as members
- Three pre-populated boards: **Q3 Product Launch**, **Engineering — Sprint 24**, **Marketing — Spring Campaign** — each with realistic cards (covers, labels, due dates, member assignments) and a week of fake activity history so the timeline isn't empty


### Demo accounts

| Role             | Email                       | Password    | Display name |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Workspace owner  | `testadmin@kompflow.com`    | `Pa$$w0rd!` | Alex Mercer  |
| Invited member   | `testuser@kompflow.com`     | `Pa$$w0rd!` | Taylor Quinn |

Both accounts share the same workspace (`Alex's Workspace`). Sign in at http://localhost:5173/login.

### Test realtime updates with two accounts

Open the app in **two different browser windows** (or one normal + one incognito) and sign in as each account. As one account drags cards, edits descriptions, or adds members, the other window's board view, sidebar, and activity feed update **live** through the self-hosted Soketi WebSocket — no refresh required. This is the cleanest way to see the full multi-user kanban experience the demo is built around.

### Test the invitation-by-email flow

While signed in as **Alex** (workspace owner):

1. Open the workspace page → **Members** panel.
2. Type any email address (e.g. `your-other-gmail@gmail.com`) → click **Send invite**.
3. The API sends a real email through the bundled Gmail SMTP credentials. The invitee receives a "You're invited to Alex's Workspace" message with a tokenized accept link.
4. Click the link → it opens `/invite/<token>` → the new user signs up (or signs in) → they're added to the workspace and an `invited` / `joined` activity row appears in the live feed for everyone watching.

If outbound email is blocked on your network, the invitation row is still visible in the workspace's pending-invitations list, and the accept URL is logged to `docker compose logs api`.

### Other commands

To stop the stack: `Ctrl+C`. To wipe the database between runs: `docker compose down -v`.

## What the demo flow looks like

1. Open http://localhost:5173 → click **Sign up** → create an account.
2. The app auto-creates a personal workspace (`<your name>'s Workspace`). It shows up in the left sidebar.
3. Click **+ New board** in the workspace view (or in the dashboard) to create a board. Three default columns (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`) are seeded automatically.
4. Add cards. Drag them between columns. Open a card to edit it (markdown supported, image embedding supported).
5. Click **🕒 Activity** in the board header — see every move/add/update logged in a Kanban-style timeline.
6. From the sidebar, switch to **Activity** for the workspace-wide feed.
7. Use the workspace switcher (top of the sidebar) → **+ Create workspace** to make a second workspace, then create boards in it.
8. From the sidebar, click **🏠 All boards** to see every board across every workspace, grouped.

## Features

### Workspaces
- Create/list/rename workspaces. Two visibility modes: `private` and `workspace-public`.
- A personal workspace is auto-created on registration so users land in a usable state.
- Boards live inside workspaces — switch between workspaces from the sidebar.

### Boards
- Create boards within a workspace. Three default columns are seeded inside a transaction.
- Drag cards between columns. Drag columns to reorder.
- The reorder endpoint accepts a single atomic payload that updates positions in one DB transaction.
- Per-card detail modal with markdown, image embedding, and (optional, per-board) end-to-end-encrypted descriptions.

### Activity feed
- Every mutation (board created/updated/deleted, column created/renamed/deleted, card added/updated/moved/transferred/removed) is logged as an `Activity` row.
- Activity rows snapshot the entity title at the time of the event, so deletions and renames don't leave gaps in the feed.
- View per-workspace (`/workspaces/:id/activity`) or per-board (Activity panel from the board header).
- New activities stream live to subscribers via Soketi/Pusher — no refresh required.

### Realtime
- Each board update fires `board.updated` on `private-board-{id}`.
- Each new activity fires `activity.created` on `private-workspace-{id}` and the originating board's channel.
- Channel auth is enforced server-side via `WorkspacesService.assertCanView` / `BoardsService.assertCanView`.

### Auth
- JWT in HTTP-only cookies. Cookie-based auth means the React SPA gets it automatically.
- Email + password (bcrypt). Optional Google OAuth — leave the env vars unset and the strategy logs a warning, OAuth buttons return 4xx, but everything else works.

## Not yet implemented

A short, honest list of things that are present in the codebase but are **not** correctly finished. Reviewers should not assume these features are production-ready.

### End-to-end encryption — incorrectly implemented

I attempted to add end-to-end encryption for card content. The cryptographic primitives (PBKDF2-SHA256 + AES-GCM) are in `apps/web/src/lib/crypto.ts`, the per-board passphrase storage is in `apps/web/src/lib/board-key.ts`, and the **Encrypt card** button on the card-detail modal does run the encrypt path on save.

However, **the overall encryption logic is incorrect** and does not satisfy the requirement that a database administrator cannot read card content. Specifically:

- Only the card **description body** is encrypted. The card **title**, **labels**, **cover**, **due date**, **member assignments**, **column titles**, **board titles**, **workspace names**, **user names**, and **activity-log entity titles** are all stored in the database as plaintext.
- The passphrase is derived per board, but it lives only in the originating browser's `sessionStorage`. There is no key-sharing mechanism, so a second workspace member cannot decrypt the same card — they see the locked state with no way to unlock.
- The decrypt-on-open UX is inconsistent: opening an encrypted card in a fresh session sometimes shows the locked state without re-prompting for the passphrase.
- Activity logs still record `entityTitle` snapshots in plaintext, leaking what action was taken on which card title even when the description is encrypted.
- There is no "rotate passphrase", "decrypt all", or recovery flow.

A reviewer reading the take-home requirement strictly ("card content should be encrypted so that even database administrators cannot read it") should treat the encryption support as **not satisfied**. Doing this correctly requires either (a) server-side at-rest encryption of all user-content columns with a key the DB admin doesn't have, or (b) true client-side E2E with per-user key pairs and workspace key sharing — both are larger pieces of work than I had time for.

## Running tests

The project ships with two test suites: Jest for the API, Vitest for the web.

```bash
# API tests (4 suites, 19 tests — auth, boards, reorder, app)
docker compose run --rm api pnpm --filter @kanban/api test

# Web tests (3 suites, 18 tests — Card component, board-key helpers, crypto helpers)
docker compose run --rm web pnpm --filter @kanban/web test --no-watch
```

Or run them locally if you have Node 22 + pnpm 10:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @kanban/shared build
pnpm --filter @kanban/api exec prisma generate
pnpm --filter @kanban/api test
pnpm --filter @kanban/web test
```

## Tech stack and why

| Layer                  | Choice                                | Why                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API framework**      | NestJS 11                             | Module system, dependency injection, validation pipes — gives every service the same shape.        |
| **DB**                 | Postgres 16 + Prisma 6                | Type-safe queries; Prisma generates the TS client from `schema.prisma`.                            |
| **Schema migration**   | `prisma db push`                      | Idempotent on every boot. Right call for a demo; production would use `prisma migrate`.            |
| **Auth**               | Passport + JWT cookies                | Standard NestJS pattern; no SPA token-juggling required.                                           |
| **Realtime**           | Pusher protocol via Soketi            | Battle-tested client (`pusher-js`), self-hosted server (`soketi`) — no external account needed.    |
| **Frontend framework** | React 19 + Vite 8                     | Fastest dev/build cycle.                                                                           |
| **Routing**            | React Router 7                        | Nested routes for the AppShell; everything authenticated lives under one `<Route element>`.        |
| **State**              | TanStack Query 5                      | Cache + invalidation for boards/workspaces/activity; `useInfiniteQuery` powers the activity feed.  |
| **Drag-and-drop**      | @dnd-kit                              | Accessible (keyboard reorder), no global state, handles columns and cards uniformly.               |
| **Styling**            | Tailwind v4 + custom CSS token system | Tailwind for utilities; `styles/app.css` and `styles/shell.css` for component classes and tokens.  |
| **Tests**              | Jest (API) + Vitest (web)             | Idiomatic per platform.                                                                            |
| **Monorepo**           | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo           | Shared TS package + per-app builds.                                                                |
| **Container**          | Docker Compose                        | One-command boot. Postgres, Soketi, API, web all wired with healthchecks and env defaults.         |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use** — Something on your host is bound to one of `3001`, `5173`, or `6001`. Stop it, or remap the host side in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3002:3001"   # access API at host :3002 instead of :3001
```

(If you change the API host port, also bump `VITE_API_URL` in `docker-compose.yml`'s `web.build.args` and rebuild.)

**API restarts on boot** — `docker compose logs api` shows the error. Most common cause is mid-flight env edits. Start fresh: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build`.

**No live activity updates** — The Soketi WebSocket needs to reach `localhost:6001` from the browser. If you're running behind a corporate proxy that strips WS, the activity feed still updates on page refresh — events are still written to the DB.

**Slow first build** — Expected. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` downloads ~800 packages on first run. Layer cache makes subsequent builds fast.

## API quick reference

All routes are prefixed `/api` and (except `/auth/*` register/login) require the JWT cookie set by login/register.

# Personal workspace was auto-provisioned
curl http://localhost:3001/api/workspaces -b /tmp/k.cookies
# → [{ name: "Demo's Workspace", _count: { boards: 0 } }]

# Create a board, fetch the workspace activity feed
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/boards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b /tmp/k.cookies \
  -d '{"workspaceId":"<id>","title":"Roadmap"}'
curl 'http://localhost:3001/api/workspaces/<id>/activity' -b /tmp/k.cookies
# → activity row { verb: "created", entityType: "board" } with full actor + workspace context
```

This entire flow runs inside `docker compose up` with zero local setup.
